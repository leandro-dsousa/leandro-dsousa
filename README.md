Hi there! My name is Leandro and I'm a software engineer.

This repository is part of a lifetime project that aims for constant self-improvement. I enjoy front-end development, being the main motivation of this work.

In here, there are projects I've engaged with that I thought that would be interesting and, most importantly, fun to do.

I do believe that this is a project that will be done for years to come, thus I cannot provide a finish date.
